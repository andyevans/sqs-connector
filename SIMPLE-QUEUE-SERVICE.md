Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers.
By using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between distributed application components performing different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each 
component to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build an automated workflow, working in close conjunction with the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) 
and the other AWS infrastructure web services.

### Important

Although it is called Queue, Amazon SQS does not guarantee FIFO access to messages in Amazon SQS queues, mainly because of the distributed nature of the Amazon SQS. 
If you require specific message ordering, you should design your application to handle it.
 
Sending a message to the Queue
------------------------------

You can send a message by using _send-message_ as follows:

    <sqs:send-message>

That will send your payload as a STRING, so, if you want to send some other object, you will have to convert it to a string, and then when you are receiving it, you'll have to
revert that conversion, to get your original object.

Receiving messages from the Queue
---------------------------------

You can start receiving messages by using _recieve-messages_ that acts like an inbound endpoint and it
can be used as such.

    <flow name="messagesConsumer">
        <!-- INBOUND ENDPOINT -->
        <sqs:recieve-messages visibilityTimeout="5" 
                              preserveMessages="false"/>
        <!-- REST OF YOUR FLOW -->
        <logger level="INFO" message="Received a message: #[payload]"/>
    </flow>

A Mule flow is divided in two. The first portion of it is usually an inbound endpoint or a message source. It is an entity that will receive/generate events that will later
be processed by the rest of the flow. The other portion is a collection of message processors which will processes the messages (aka events) received/generated by the inbound
endpoint.

Every time our _messages Consumer_ receives a message it will execute the rest of the flow. In the case, it will log a message at INFO level.

### Parameters

The _preserveMessages_ parameter is a flag that indicates if you want to preserve the messages (_true_), or delete them (_false_) from the queue after you get them.
By default, it will delete them.

The _visibilityTimeout_ it's an integer that represents the duration (in seconds) the retrieved message is hidden from subsequent calls to retrieve.
For example, if you only have a message in the queue, and you retrieve it with a _visibilityTimeout_ of 5 second, you will have an "empty" queue, until "appears" again in 5 seconds.
